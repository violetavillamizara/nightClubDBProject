### Requirements
## Conceptual model

As the client, running a nightclub business, I have specific needs for the database to ensure smooth operations and efficient management. Here are some key elements and functionalities that I require:

    Customer Management:
        Store customer details, including names, contact information, and membership status.
        Track customer preferences, such as favorite drinks or music genres.
        Record attendance history for special events or regular nights.

    Employee Management:
        Maintain a staff database with details like names, roles, contact information, and work schedules.
        Track performance metrics and attendance of employees.

    Inventory Management:
        Keep track of bar inventory, including types and quantities of beverages, garnishes, and other supplies.
        Set up alerts for low inventory levels to avoid running out of popular items during peak hours.

    Event Management:
        Schedule and manage events, parties, and promotions.
        Keep records of past events, including attendance numbers and revenue generated.

    Reservation System:
        Implement a reservation system for VIP tables or special events.
        Record customer preferences for seating arrangements.

    Security and Access Control:
        Implement a secure login system with different access levels for staff members.
        Keep track of entry and exit times for employees and security personnel.

    Financial Management:
        Record and track all financial transactions, including income and expenses.
        Generate financial reports for analysis and decision-making.

    Marketing and Promotions:
        Manage customer databases for targeted marketing campaigns.
        Record the success of different promotional activities.

    Music and Entertainment:
        Keep track of music playlists and DJ schedules.
        Record customer feedback on entertainment offerings.

    Feedback and Reviews:
        Collect and manage customer feedback and reviews.
        Use feedback to make improvements and enhance customer experience.

By addressing these specific aspects, the database would help streamline operations, enhance customer experience, and provide valuable insights for business growth and development.
